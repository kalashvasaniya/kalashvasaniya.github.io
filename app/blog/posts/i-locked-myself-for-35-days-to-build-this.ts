    35 days. no distractions. no excuses. just me, my laptop, and a vision. i locked myself away to build something that mattered.

    it started with frustration. too many half-finished projects. too many "i'll do it tomorrow" promises. too much noise. i needed to prove something to myself.

    <img src="/blog/1_z43IuIWFOXqOnWeiV_GRNA.png" alt="Screenshot showing the 35-day building journey and results" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto; margin: 20px 0; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;" />

    day 1: excitement. day 7: doubt. day 14: questioning everything. day 21: breakthrough. day 35: something real.

    here's what i learned about deep work and building in isolation:

    1. environment matters more than motivation:
    i cleared my space. removed every distraction. no social media. no news. no unnecessary apps. when your environment supports your goals, motivation becomes irrelevant.

    2. small wins compound:
    day 1: 100 lines of code. day 2: 150 lines. day 3: 200 lines. by day 30, i was writing 500+ lines daily. consistency beats intensity every time.

    3. isolation reveals your true priorities:
    when you remove all the noise, you see what actually matters. i thought i needed to check twitter every hour. turns out, i didn't. i thought i needed to respond to every message immediately. i didn't.

    4. progress is invisible until it's not:
    days 1-10 felt like i was going nowhere. same routine. same struggles. same doubts. then day 11 hit and everything clicked. trust the process.

    5. building in public is overrated:
    sometimes you need to build in private. to fail in private. to figure things out without an audience. not everything needs to be shared immediately.

    6. time blocking is everything:
    6am-8am: deep work. 8am-9am: break. 9am-12pm: deep work. 12pm-1pm: lunch. 1pm-5pm: deep work. 5pm-6pm: planning tomorrow. rinse. repeat.

    7. your brain adapts to focus:
    first week: mind wandering every 20 minutes. second week: 45 minutes of focus. third week: 2-hour deep work sessions. fourth week: 4-hour sessions. your brain learns what you teach it.

    8. physical health affects mental output:
    i exercised daily. ate clean. slept 8 hours. your body is your machine. treat it well and it will perform.

    9. documentation is crucial:
    i wrote down every breakthrough, every failure, every lesson. when you're in the zone, you think you'll remember everything. you won't.

    10. the real work happens in the middle:
    beginnings are exciting. endings are satisfying. the middle is where most people quit. day 15-25 was brutal. that's where champions are made.

    what did i build? something that matters to me. something that solves a real problem. something that i'm proud of. the details don't matter as much as the process.

    would i do it again? absolutely. but differently. i'd plan better. i'd have clearer milestones. i'd build in more reflection time.

    if you're thinking about doing something similar:

    start small: try 7 days first
    plan your environment: remove distractions
    set clear goals: what exactly are you building?
    track progress: write everything down
    be patient: real work takes time

    i'm not saying lock yourself away for 35 days. but maybe lock yourself away for 35 hours. or 35 minutes of focused work daily. start where you are.

    the point isn't the isolation. it's the commitment. it's the focus. it's the willingness to do whatever it takes to build something that matters.

    i write more here and post daily on <a href="https://twitter.com/amikalash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">twitter</a>. if you're serious about building, start now.

    p.s. if you're reading this and thinking "i could never do that" - you're right. you can't. not yet. but you can start with 1 hour of focused work today. that's how it begins.
