    all started when i found out about <a href="https://www.x.com/marc_louvion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">marc lou</a> and his journey of building.

i was inspired by his journey and decided to do the same. i wanted to build something that mattered to me. i wanted to prove something to myself.

i started with a simple idea: build a tool that helps any founder, developer, or indie hacker build their product faster - even if they're not a developer.

so i built <a href="https://superfa.st" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">superfa.st</a>.

i started in late march. built it completely solo. took me 35 days to build and launched it on may 4, 2025.

this is what my day looked like:

</a>

i was so focused on building that i didn't even notice the time passing by.

i was still in college at that time. i coded from 8pm to 8am.

i was totally locked in.

superfast is special. really special. 

superfast gives you everything you need to launch fast. no complex setup, no endless config, just powerful tools that work out of the box. focus on your product while we handle the heavy lifting. <a href="https://www.superfa.st/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">learn more about superfast</a>.

if you're a developer trying to ship faster, read the <a href="https://docs.superfa.st/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">docs</a> and see what you can build.

and i finally made money out of it. first sale is always special.

          </a>

          i always wanted to build a product that helps people. solo, no team, because at the same time i want to travel the world. like a nomad. check my <a href="/bucketlist" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;" >bucket list</a>.

what did i build? something that mattered to me. something that solved a real problem. something that i'm proud of. the details don't matter as much as the process.

would i do it again? absolutely. but differently. i'd plan better. i'd set clearer milestones. i'd build in more reflection time.

if you're thinking about doing something similar:

<div style="background: #fef3c7; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 30px 0; border: 1px solid #f59e0b;">
- start small: try 7 days first
<br />
- plan your environment: remove distractions  
<br />
- set clear goals: what exactly are you building?  
<br />
- track progress: write everything down  
<br />
- be patient: real work takes time  
<br />
</div>

i'm not saying lock yourself away for 35 days. but maybe lock yourself away for 35 hours. or 35 minutes of focused work daily. start where you are.

the point isn't the isolation. it's the commitment. it's the focus. it's the willingness to do whatever it takes to build something that matters.

35 days later, i didn't just have a product - i had proof. proof that focus beats everything. proof that when you cut the noise and commit, you can do more than you think.

i went in with an idea. i came out with something real, something helping people, and the quiet confidence that i can do it again.

if you've been waiting for the perfect time - it's not coming. lock in for a few hours, a few days, or if you're crazy enough, 35. build something that matters.

<div style="background: #fef3c7; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 30px 0; border: 1px solid #f59e0b;">
  <p style="margin: 0; color: #92400e; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">
    "the real win isn't the product. it's the person you become building it."
  </p>
</div>

i write more here and post daily on <a href="https://twitter.com/amikalash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">twitter</a>. if you're serious about building, start now.

p.s. if you're reading this and thinking “i could never do that” - you're right. you can't. not yet. but you can start with 1 hour of focused work today. that's how it begins.
