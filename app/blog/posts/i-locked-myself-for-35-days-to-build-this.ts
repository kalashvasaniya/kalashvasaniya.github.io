    all started when i found about <a href="https://www.x.com/marc_louvion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">marc lou</a> and his journey of building.

    </a>

    i was inspired by his journey and decided to do the same. i wanted to build something that mattered to me. i wanted to prove something to myself.

    i started with a simple idea: build a tool that helps any founder, developer or indie-hacker to build their product faster. even if they're not a developer.

    so i built <a href="https://superfa.st" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">superfa.st</a> 



    what did i build? something that matters to me. something that solves a real problem. something that i'm proud of. the details don't matter as much as the process.

    would i do it again? absolutely. but differently. i'd plan better. i'd have clearer milestones. i'd build in more reflection time.

    if you're thinking about doing something similar:

    start small: try 7 days first
    plan your environment: remove distractions
    set clear goals: what exactly are you building?
    track progress: write everything down
    be patient: real work takes time

    i'm not saying lock yourself away for 35 days. but maybe lock yourself away for 35 hours. or 35 minutes of focused work daily. start where you are.

    the point isn't the isolation. it's the commitment. it's the focus. it's the willingness to do whatever it takes to build something that matters.

    i write more here and post daily on <a href="https://twitter.com/amikalash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">twitter</a>. if you're serious about building, start now.

    p.s. if you're reading this and thinking "i could never do that" - you're right. you can't. not yet. but you can start with 1 hour of focused work today. that's how it begins.
