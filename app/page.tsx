            i'm just a guy that loves creating things for others.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            i started my first company at 13 when i sold dragon ball z tenkaichi budokai 2 in 2009 on ebay.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            selling stuff online turned into my high school obsession and i grew that company to $100K in revenue per year by expanding to products like <a href="#" className="text-blue-600 underline">these</a> and <a href="#" className="text-blue-600 underline">these</a>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            been making stuff ever since.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            most recently, i'm the founder of <a href="https://www.superfa.st/" target="_blank" className="text-blue-600 underline">superfast</a> â€” a next.js boilerplate that helps developers go from idea to revenue in just days.

            did a bunch of stuff before.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            founded an online elementary school called zipschool focused on homeschoolers and grew it to 150,000 kiddos, trained a real time cv model that would coach you in overwatch named visor (we got really big actually, then, blizzard banned us oops), was cto at kanga where we built our own models to recommend gamers content they'd enjoy, trained my own open-source deep learning models for esports analytics, built random products for league of legends that got to 1m+ users, built a dumb ar menu app that got no where, and built a bunch of other random stupid shit that was meaningless but fun (lol).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            some stuff above worked out.
            most of it didn't.
            but, i learned a lot.
          </p>
