            i'm just a guy who builds stuff. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bento.me/kalashvasaniya" className="text-blue-600 underline">find me</a>.
          </p>

            full-stack developer, indie hacker, and occasional writer. i build products that help people ship faster.
          </p>

          <p>
            when i was 17, i had an idea to build a social media platform for college students. i wanted it anonymous, so i built <a href="https://www.thepairup.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">thepairup</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            ok, i'm not done yet.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="https://www.thepairup.in/" target="_blank" className="text-blue-600 underline">thepairup</a> brutally failed. i thought i was the next mark zuckerberg. went all in for 3 months, coding 12â€“14 hours a day. and i was the only one who signed up.
          </p>

          <p>
            back to the present, i'm the founder of <a href="https://www.superfa.st/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">superfast</a>, a next.js boilerplate that helps developers go from idea to revenue in just days.

          <p>2025 is my year.</p>

          <p>
            i always wanted to build a product that helps people. solo, no team, because at the same time i want to travel the world. like a nomad. check my <a href="/bucketlist" className="text-blue-600 underline">bucket list</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            and i found out about <a href="https://x.com/marc_louvion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">marc lou</a>, the legend.
          </p>

          <p>
            he built 26+ products. all solo. traveling the world and making 6 figures a month.
          </p>

          <p>
            i was like, "i can do this too".
          </p>

          <p>
            so in feb 2025, i started building thepairup again. but this time with a different idea. i removed anonymity and made it for college students.
          </p>

          <p>
            but to build a huge platform like this, i needed a team, servers, money, and time. so i paused the project. after 2 months of working on it, i realized i want to build solo. (p.s. maybe in the future i'll build it with a team)
          </p>

          <p>
            so i started building <a href="https://www.superfa.st/" target="_blank" className="text-blue-600 underline">superfast</a>. i started in late march. built it completely solo. took me 35 days to build and launched it on may 4, 2025.
          </p>

          <p>
            in the meantime, i also started adding some passive income. i began writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@kalashvasaniya1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">medium</a>.
